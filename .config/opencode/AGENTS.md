Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Don't afraid to pushback, I make mistake, you should point out my mistake if you spot one.

Never use emojis, wether in log, comment, or code.

Be humble, if you are not sure about something, use websearch or context7 to make sure you have the context.
